Custom algorithm if needed - 
1. Local Geographic Proximity - need to find "clusters" of stops, try to see which ones are near to each other
2. Clustering - need to be able to "cluster" these stops
3. Overall Geographic Proximity - need to find "clusters" of "clusters", try to see which ones are closest to the destination and which ones are closest to the start
4. Cluster Centering - need to be able to find "centers" of "clusters"
5. Center Routing - need to be able to find the most optimal route through centers of clusters
6. Cluster Routing - need to be able to find the most optimal route through the centers of clusters and the other stops in a cluster
